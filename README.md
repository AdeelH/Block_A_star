Python implementation of Block A* search. (Class project, Robotics, 2019)


Based on [Yap, P., Burch, N., Holte, R. C., & Schaeffer, J. (2011, August). _Block A*: Database-driven search with applications in any-angle path-planning_. In Twenty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3449/3819
)


To reproduce the experiment results, simply run `experiment.py`. 
```
> python experiment.py
```
The experiment parameters can be changed by editing the file.

See `run.py` for running the algorithm on specific maps.
